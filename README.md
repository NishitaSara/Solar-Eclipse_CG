# Solar-Eclipse_CG

 The solar eclipse animation mini project aims to create a visually accurate representation of a solar eclipse using OpenGL and computer graphics techniques. This project will simulate the celestial alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, showcasing the various phases of a solar eclipse, including total, partial, and annular eclipses.
 
 The animation will involve modeling realistic 3D representations of the sun and moon, applying appropriate textures and lighting effects, and animating their movements to illustrate the eclipse process. Key challenges include ensuring accurate timing and positioning to reflect the dynamics of an actual solar eclipse, as well as implementing smooth transitions between different phases.
  
 The final output will be a high-quality animation suitable for educational presentations, promoting interest in astronomy and computer graphics.
